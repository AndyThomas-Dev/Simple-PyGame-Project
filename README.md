# Simple PyGame Project

A simple game coded in Python using the PyGame framework.

The aim of this project for me was to get an initial understanding of the PyGame framework with a view towards building a more complex game in the near future.

The basis of the game has been constructed in-line with the tutorial on RealPython.com located [here](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/#background-and-setup).

The game demonstrates use of sprites, sprite groups, events, collision detection and sound effects.
